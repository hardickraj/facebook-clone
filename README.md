# facebook-clone
Facebook clone is my personal project for practice and exercise purpose
and also to showcase my skills and learnings.
Site is full responsive in all device width.
This is a frontend website made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Used TailwindCSS for css framework.
Used Vite for the local server and to build the site for deployment.
